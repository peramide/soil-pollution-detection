# soil-pollution-detection
This project models soil and groundwater pollution as a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to estimate true pollution levels from noisy sensor readings. By using probabilistic inference (forward and Viterbi algorithms), the model predicts how likely the site is to be highly polluted and identifies the most probable pollution path over time.
